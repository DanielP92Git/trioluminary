    "aboutTrio": "Luminary Trio is the creation of three musicians, graduates of the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance — Daniel Pagis (piano), Shir Tayeb (violin), and Tomer Amikam (bass clarinet).\nThe unique combination of piano, violin, and bass clarinet creates a rich and profound harmony, offering a distinctive color and interpretation to a broad classical repertoire. The trio’s repertoire includes gems by some of the greatest classical composers, such as Mozart, Schubert, Franck, Clara Schumann and more.\nIn addition, the ensemble incorporates works by Israeli composers as well as arrangements of beloved songs like \"Jerusalem of Gold\", \"Hora He'achzut\", and \"When a Light Shines in Your Window\".\nWe invite you to join us on a captivating musical journey — exploring world classics in a new light and melodies that resonate with the soul of the Israeli spirit.",
